# General instructions for GitHub Copilot

- Do not change layout or formatting of existing code that does not need to be changed to add the new work. 
- Do not follow the (boy) scout rule. Only change code that is necessary to add the new work.
- When adding logging statements, surround variables with brackets in the log when showing their values
- Imports always go on the top of the file, never in between
- When displaying large numbers, use European metric notation: dots (.) as thousand separators and commas (,) for decimals. Example: `101.891` for one hundred thousand, `90,38%` for percentages with decimals
