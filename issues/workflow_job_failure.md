### Workflow Job Failure Summary

**Reference:** `aff19e76203dd165831f175873bc2b07e1618978`  
**Error:** Unauthorized (HTTP 401)

The workflow job failed due to token validation issues. The logs indicate that the GitHub PAT may be invalid or expired. Actionable guidance includes:
- Check that the PAT secret is set correctly and is valid.
- Ensure that the required scopes for the PAT are set to 'repo' and 'user'.

### Suggested Improvement:

Please update the workflow error handling to explicitly mention the required scopes when this error occurs.
