Hi, I am Rob. 

I do DevOps-y stuff, mostly with C# and Azure/Azure DevOps/GitHub.
I experiment with a lot of this stuff here on GitHub, and blog about it [here](https://rajbos.github.io).

## Community | GDBC
I help out with the Global DevOps Bootcamp [link](https://globaldevopsbootcamp.com), mostly with automating stuff and setting up the infrastructure we need each year. 
Last year we had over 10.000 attendees spread out all over the world, spending their free Saturday with our platform getting hands-on experience on DevOps topics.

## Work | Xpirit
In my day job I work for Xpirit as a DevOps consultant, helping our customers with whatever they need regarding development. Wether it's training, finding out some obscure issues, setting up their CI/CD pipelines, or helping them on their way to implement more DevOps stuff, I help them with it.

## AzDo Marketplace updates
I created a Twitter bot named [AzDoMarketNews](https://twitter.com/azdomarketnews) to keep up to date on new and improved extensions on the Azure DevOps marketplace.
