## Hi, I am Rob :wave:
I do DevOps-y stuff, mostly with C# and Azure/Azure DevOps/GitHub. As a job I am a DevOps consultant and (GitHub) Trainer at [Xpirit](www.xpirit.com).  
I experiment with a lot of this stuff here on GitHub, and blog about it [here](https://devopsjournal.io).   
The dog in my profile photo is our Labrador named "Flynn".

## GitHub Actions Internal Marketplace üçµ
To create an internal marketplace for your org I've created guidance in [this blogpost](https://devopsjournal.io/blog/2021/10/14/GitHub-Actions-Internal-Marketplace) and created multiple repositories that can help:
* Internal Markplace Website: [repo](https://github.com/rajbos/github-actions-requests)
* Keeping your forks up to date: [repo](https://github.com/rajbos/github-fork-updater)
* Loading the actions from your internal marketplace: [repo](https://github.com/rajbos/github-action-load-available-actions)
* Loading the actions used in your organization: [repo](https://github.com/rajbos/github-action-load-used-actions)  
* Request actions to be added to your internal actions marketplace: [repo](https://github.com/rajbos/github-actions-requests)

## Community | GDBC :otter:
I help out with the Global DevOps Bootcamp ([link](https://globaldevopsbootcamp.com)), mostly with automating stuff and setting up the infrastructure we need each year. In the 2019 edition we had over 10.000 attendees spread out all over the world, spending their free Saturday with our platform getting hands-on experience on DevOps topics. For the 2020 edition I've started vlogging about the relevant information/announcements/background stuff [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCnpc4jNC9lBWh-oq3aaPfFP5_tUMy7ZJ) and I have spoken about the event and platform for it several times. The session on DevOps Fest 2020 was recorded [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJOnXj3pbKU&list=PLuOBDBq7MW73LKG7492aCRpSkLqqlJp32&index=25).
